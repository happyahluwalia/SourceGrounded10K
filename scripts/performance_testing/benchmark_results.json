According to this section, the company faces a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of its operations infringe competition or consumer protection rules. Additionally, Amazon's results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies (Document 2).\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's operations are subject to a large number of jurisdictions regulating its activities, which can lead to evolving and expanding regulations that may impact the company's business (Document 3). This uncertainty is reflected in the company's forward-looking statements, which are subject to substantial uncertainty and may differ materially from actual results (Document 1).\n\nAccording to Document 2, Amazon provided guidance on February\u00a06, 2025, but noted that its results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors. This suggests that investors should be cautious when considering the company's future prospects.\n\nOverall, the main risk factors for investing in Amazon include regulatory risks, operational uncertainties, and market-related risks, which can impact the company's financial performance and stock price.",

Microsoft's overall gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of scaling its AI infrastructure, particularly in the Intelligent Cloud segment (Document 10).\n\nIn summary, while Apple's total gross margin is slightly higher in absolute terms ($195,201 million vs. $193,893 million), Microsoft has a significantly higher gross margin percentage (69% for its cloud business vs. 46.9% overall for Apple).",

        "full_answer": "Amazon's policy on stock-based compensation includes the following key points:\n\n1. **Measurement of Compensation Cost**: The company measures the compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes this cost over the service period (Document 1).\n\n2. **Fair Value Determination**: The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of Amazon's common stock. This value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method (Document 1).\n\n3. **Vesting Periods**: Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over a service term generally between two and five years. The majority of these awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 as part of the annual compensation review, with vesting primarily occurring semi-annually in Q2 and Q4 (Document 2).\n\n4. **Stock Award Activity**: Amazon reports detailed stock-based compensation expense across various segments, including cost of sales, fulfillment, technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, the total stock-based compensation expense was $19,621 million, $24,023 million, and $22,011 million, respectively (Document 2).\n\n5. **Tax Benefits**: The related tax benefits for stock-based compensation were $4.3 billion, $5.4 billion, and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively (Document 5).\n\n6. **Shareholder Dilution Management**: Amazon seeks to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes. They use restricted stock units as the primary vehicle for equity compensation to align the long-term interests of shareholders and employees (Document 3).\n\n7. **Outstanding Restricted Stock Units**: As of December 31, 2024, Amazon had 283.1 million outstanding restricted stock units with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $145. The scheduled vesting for these units is as follows: 146.0 million in 2025, 88.5 million in 2026",

The amount recognized is based on the quantity of services rendered, such as the compute or storage capacity delivered (Document 1).\n\n2. **Fixed Quantity Over a Specified Term**: For certain AWS services, including compute and database, that are offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period (Document 1).\n\n3. **Sales Commissions**: Sales commissions paid in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term (Document 1).\n\n4. **Unearned Revenue**: As of December 31, 2024, Amazon had $24.6 billion in total unearned revenue, which includes performance obligations primarily related to AWS. For long-term contracts exceeding one year, the commitments not yet recognized were approximately $177 billion, with a weighted average remaining life of 4.1 years (Document 2).\n\nThese policies ensure that revenue is recognized in a manner that aligns with the delivery and usage of AWS services by customers.",

        "full_answer": "According to the provided SEC filings, Amazon's policy on stock-based compensation primarily involves the use of restricted stock units (RSUs) as a key component of employee equity compensation. The RSU awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 annually during the compensation review and vest over service periods generally ranging from two to five years. Vesting typically occurs semi-annually in Q2 and Q4.\n\nThe fair value of these RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of Amazon's common stock at the date of grant, with this value recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using an accelerated method. As of December 31, 2024, there was $16.2 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, expected to be expensed on an accelerated basis within the next twelve months.\n\nAmazon believes this model aligns long-term interests between employees and shareholders while efficiently managing shareholder dilution (Document 3). The company also maintains a stock repurchase program but did not execute any repurchases in 2023 or 2024, leaving $6.1 billion remaining under the program as of December 31, 2024 (Document 2).\n\nThe total stock-based compensation expense for Amazon was $19.621 billion in 2022, $24.023 billion in 2023, and $22.011 billion in 2024, with related tax benefits of $4.3 billion, $5.4 billion, and $5.0 billion for the respective years (Document 4).",

        "full_answer": "According to Document 1, Amazon's revenue recognition policy for AWS services involves allocating revenue based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenue is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. For certain services like compute and database that are offered with a fixed quantity over a specified term, revenue is recognized ratably. Additionally, sales commissions paid in connection with contracts exceeding one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nAccording to Document 2, Amazon had total unearned revenue of $24.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, with a significant portion related to AWS performance obligations for future services not yet recognized in financial statements amounting to approximately $177 billion as of the same date.\n\nThese policies and figures provide insight into how Amazon manages its revenue recognition specifically for AWS services.",
